            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>I decided to make a webpage that is reminicent of mini-game websites, such as Newgrounds, kongregate, and miniclip.</p>
            <p>Each game would be contained in its own page with its own leaderboard. When you complete a game you can submit your score to the leaderboard to see where you rank.</p>
